    • Used Feature extraction (DWT, PDS, FFT, RMS, STD) and Feature Selection (PCA, LDA) methods to extract 5
    most discriminating features out of Human Gesture data from 37 users.
    • Used Myo Sensor to record the movements (gesture data) and classified them using CNN, SVM, and Decision tree
    • Used accuracy and precision % to choose the best feature
