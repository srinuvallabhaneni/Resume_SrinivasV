    • Used Feature extraction (DWT, PDS, FFT, RMS, STD) and Feature Selection (PCA, LDA) methods to extract 5
    most discriminating features out of Human Gesture data from 37 users, which is collected using myo sensor bands.
    And then classified them using CNN, SVM, and Decision tree algorithms using accuracy and precision % to select the best feature

    • Classified images based on similarity and dissimilarity score using TF, TF-IDF values from textual and visual
    descriptors. Selected features using PCA, SVD, LDA, CPD & Page-Rank methods and then recommended images
    using kNN, Spectral clustering, k-Means Clustering, PageRank and PPR methods.And then implemented multidimensional index structure for NN search and visualized the relevant recommended images in web
    browser

    • Predicted a human subject is high or normal math capable from brain connectivity graphs from 114 human subjects.
      Extracted topological features such as clustering coefficient, edge betweenness & local efficiency from brain network graphs using NetworkX library in python. (Selected 2 classes that best differentiates as input to the classifiers)
      Classified the data using different models like SVM, Logistic regression, KNN for predictions and found that SVM provides the highest accuracy score. (Labelled subjects with math capability over 120 as 1 and others as 0)

    • Built an app using machine learning techniques to determine the failure or success of a movie by collecting tweets
    from twitter on AWS platform. Amazon S3 bucket was used to store the collected tweets. Amazon EC2 instances were used for computing and
    ganglia for benchmarking the application developed.

    • The SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images are segmented into water, vegetation, urban areas and any kind of noises in
    the land-water classification are removed. A supervised classification algorithm has been used to classify the SAR
    images. The segments are labeled as water and urban areas using SVM classification. Any kind of speckle noise is also
    removed.
